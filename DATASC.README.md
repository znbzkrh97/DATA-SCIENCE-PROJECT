# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT
🔹 Overview
This repository contains my work on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. 
The project demonstrates how raw datasets can be transformed into structured, reliable data and how EDA techniques uncover meaningful insights, trends, and anomalies that support better decision-making.
